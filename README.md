In Bulgarian healthcare there are some unique challenges, due to the nature of the medical data, being unstructured. Some key predictors for health such as the smoking status are described in an unstructured way in medical rec-ords, which makes impossible simple retrieval with or without regular expres-sions, or manual check due to the large number of records available. Large Language Models are a viable alternative to automate the process of extraction of medical data from unstructured records due to their ability to process natural language, even some for which they lack enough or specific training, such as Bulgarian language. We develop a method and a procedure to test multiple LLMs for that purpose and obtain some promising results that show their capa-bilities. We analyze the results in the context of the price of the service and the computational costs.
